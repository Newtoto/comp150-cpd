WEEK 1 (Lego bots + Computing philosophy): 

In week 1 we were designing, building and programming robots to perform a set of tasks. At least within my team strenths seem polarised with
members either being good at building/designing or programming, but I feel like I lay in the middle of those 2 sides with at least some ability with both. This
bridging of the gap meant that I was able to link together the sides and allow the construction to make programming easier and vice versa.

In hindsight, we spent too long building different itterations and not enought time getting the robot out onto the field to physically test out the obstacles.

Alongside this I got the worksheet A/Spacechem tasks and some where quite tricky, requiring a lot of thought. The best method I found was to get something
down and work from there, either to complete the level, or just come up with a more efficient solution. A paper was also given which tried to define when a system
computes with use of abstract physics, this will definitely require more readthroughs to understand.

WEEK 2 (IDE intro - PyCharm, Socrative questions on basic Python, assymetrical grid and tower defence board game designs + pitching, pair programming)

This week we were introduction to PyCharm, I am familiar with the other IDE's PHPStorm and to some extent Visual studio so it seemed fairly simple to use. 
There were some socrative questions on some basic python which I didn't struggle with as I'd looked into some python coding before I came, but my python knowledge 
is very basic, so I think this is going to be the only session in which I can answer the questions without too much thought.

For comp150 we made designs for board games, initially starting with a design for a "Race to the end" type board game, as per the brief. My contribution was an
assymetrical, yet gridlike, system to give randomised gamespace. The other aspects were mainly from the rest of my team's contribution. The main difficulty with 
this exercise was to get the initial idea out there, but once something was down on paper, after prompting from a short deadline of a playable prototype, it grew 
with contributions coming from around the table. The other board game was a similar scenario, with us struggling to come up with a tower defence
board game within the time constraints, not helped by everyone's lack of knowledge or experience with that genre of boardgame. In pitching the games, I could see
that a different approach needs to be taken into account for each of the audiences and that some flaws with the game didn't impede the pitch in certain cases due
to the nature/level of the information that needed to be given.

We also did pair programming, but my partner went to the toilet and by the time they were back I was done, whoops. The principle was there, but I would most likely
see more benefit from this practice had the task not provided most of the code.

WEEK 3 (Psudocode and flowcharts more complex python, agile game dev - trello sprint boards, using pycharm and pyGame)

This week started with psudocode and flowcharts, also in this lecture, more complex python was introduced with for and while loop examples being brought in which I
found a lot harder to compute in my head than the previous session. In making my own flowchart, it was quite difficult to keep it tidy as I thought of more and more
stages to add as I went along, so trying to stay at an appropriate level of abstraction is the main challenge. Psudocode made a lot of sense to me, since it only
requires you to follow your own convention consistantly I found it fairly easy to represent the given task in psudocode form. This may be different if I'm faced with
representing a larger task as psudocode, but if I decide on my own conventions now, it will be easier down the line to stick to them.

In the studio/workshop, the main focus was on agile game development. I am somewhat familiar with agile development from my web dev job and I was able to understand
how to use trello since it was similar to jira which I have used before. The challenges in this session were coming up with user stories, and breaking down the
tasks that needed to be done into small enough segments so that they could be worked on my different people and be brought together afterwards.

The tinkering workshop introduced a practical on pyCharm which I have really enjoyed messing around with for several hours creating some kind of drawing game/tool
and picking up relevant pyGame coding which I can apply to characters and objects in future game projects on the software.

WEEK 4 (Logic gates, memory and image manipulation)

Logic gates and memory to the extent that we looked at them was fairly simple so no issues there.

The biggest challenge came from when I started on the task for the contracts. The main difficulty of this has been trying to think of ways to implement what I want
without a lot of knowledge about the capabilities of pygame, meaning that a method I had in mind may not be practical. The solution to this will really come from.
I just more practice of the code and getting to know what it can do and come up with practical solutions to the functionality I want to achieve.

WEEK 5 (Time complexity, game pitches and more graphics)

I struggled with time complexity this week. I understand the basic for loops and embedded for loops, but when it comes to running an embedded loop "j" up to "i-1" I can't figure out what the big O notation would be. I should be able to overcome this by researching a little into more common terms and methods of deriving big O notation from an algorithm.

WEEK 6 (OOP and Scholarly writing)

I seem to overall understand what was taught about OOP and the scholarly writing. The main difficulty for me now has come from the tinkering graphics project in which I am struggling with how to best organise my code for editing. I'm going to try out a few ways and see which I find the most legible with reference to some outside sources on coding cleanliness.

WEEK 7

With the group game projects under way and as the scrum master, I found it hard to organise my team with us all working at different times and also having other things to work on simultaneously. Since my essay relates to this, I will try and apply some of my research to my scrum.

WEEK 8 (7thNOV)

The greatest difficulty this week was apparent at the sprint review where there were still things left in "In Progress" and "To Do". I will try and reduce the amount in the sprint to a more managable quantity and make sure every member knows what it is they need to do.

<h2>Semester 2 CPD</h2>
<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>This first week, with the product owner meeting and the supervised session have reinforced the feeling that I didn't use Christmas in a productive manner. I have a habit of peaking and troughing  pretty severely when it comes to my motivation to do work and this applies across everything I do. It’s probably a good idea to set out specific production goals and try not to deviate too much from that. Obviously it’s natural to want to enjoy a break, but I’m all too aware that summer is going to be about 4 months and if I am able to apply myself to a regime of minimum production (after a wee break now and then of course) this could prove to be a very useful time to fine tune what I’ve learnt and pick up some extra skills before next year.</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>The communication for our team project has been somewhat lacking, there are certainly a couple of members who are slacking with their work, but it’s less clear if this is the case when we don’t talk enough to pass on what our personal progress has been. The mandelbrot worksheet has proved to be a tricky endevour, but with some messing around with it for a while my understanding for it has definitely improved and I was actually able to troubleshoot someone else’s in about 10 seconds which is always a nice moral boost, knowing that I have at least some comprehension of what’s going on. My mandlebrot did end up with a mixture of doubles and floats which came from a lack of knowing exactly what the difference was.</p>

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>Researching custom controllers is fun. The exploration of what wacky things have been created to operate games has opened up my mind to the possibilities of what could be achieved if you deviate from joysticks and just simple buttons. I have 4 designs for my custom controller which I have run past a few people for opinions to which the outcome was a resounding preference for the laser puzzle game. I tried making this game in unity, but really my limited skillset within the unity-sphere is making it very difficult to know what to search for, and since the game is a puzzle, there are no real explicit tutorials I can watch. I’d have to derive the functionality that I want to add from several tutorials, and I don’t have time for this right now, so I’m going to move over to unreal since I can somewhat visualise how I’m going to implement what I planned. Know your skill base, what you’re planning on doing, and pick an engine to match. That’s what I’m taking from this, that and I’m going to try and increase my unity knowledge base in the background just to open up options in the future. Summer will play a big part in how much unity I learn too.</p>

<h3>Week 4</h3>
<p>This week I have decided to have another crack at the lacking communication amongst the team with the assistance of a trello slack intergation to forward any Trello changes to a slack room. This is also to motivate myself to participate more in agile practices as that has been the outlying field in the sprint retrospectives. My previous attempt of the daily stand up slack room didn't work as there was an aversion to holding stand ups online due to them not working for some people in their last project. On that topic, "daily" stand ups are still having issues in that there is never everyone in(except PO meetings which I'll give my team credit for), whether it be from lectures, oversleeping (I've been guilt of this one), or general can't be arsed-ness. I may have to have another push on the slack stand ups as just a line or two about progress keeps everyone informed and may motivate more contribution from some of the team as there is definitely a larger discrepency in effort than I'd like. My work split at the moment is far too skewed towards the worksheets and the group project and I need to make sure I start adding contributions to the wiki and read more sources for both the upcomming essays.</p>
