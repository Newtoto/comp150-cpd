WEEK 1 (Lego bots + Computing philosophy): 

In week 1 we were designing, building and programming robots to perform a set of tasks. At least within my team strenths seem polarised with
members either being good at building/designing or programming, but I feel like I lay in the middle of those 2 sides with at least some ability with both. This
bridging of the gap meant that I was able to link together the sides and allow the construction to make programming easier and vice versa.

In hindsight, we spent too long building different itterations and not enought time getting the robot out onto the field to physically test out the obstacles.

Alongside this I got the worksheet A/Spacechem tasks and some where quite tricky, requiring a lot of thought. The best method I found was to get something
down and work from there, either to complete the level, or just come up with a more efficient solution. A paper was also given which tried to define when a system
computes with use of abstract physics, this will definitely require more readthroughs to understand.

WEEK 2 (IDE intro - PyCharm, Socrative questions on basic Python, assymetrical grid and tower defence board game designs + pitching, pair programming)

This week we were introduction to PyCharm, I am familiar with the other IDE's PHPStorm and to some extent Visual studio so it seemed fairly simple to use. 
There were some socrative questions on some basic python which I didn't struggle with as I'd looked into some python coding before I came, but my python knowledge 
is very basic, so I think this is going to be the only session in which I can answer the questions without too much thought.

For comp150 we made designs for board games, initially starting with a design for a "Race to the end" type board game, as per the brief. My contribution was an
assymetrical, yet gridlike, system to give randomised gamespace. The other aspects were mainly from the rest of my team's contribution. The main difficulty with 
this exercise was to get the initial idea out there, but once something was down on paper, after prompting from a short deadline of a playable prototype, it grew 
with contributions coming from around the table. The other board game was a similar scenario, with us struggling to come up with a tower defence
board game within the time constraints, not helped by everyone's lack of knowledge or experience with that genre of boardgame. In pitching the games, I could see
that a different approach needs to be taken into account for each of the audiences and that some flaws with the game didn't impede the pitch in certain cases due
to the nature/level of the information that needed to be given.

We also did pair programming, but my partner went to the toilet and by the time they were back I was done, whoops. The principle was there, but I would most likely
see more benefit from this practice had the task not provided most of the code.

WEEK 3 (Psudocode and flowcharts more complex python, agile game dev - trello sprint boards, using pycharm and pyGame)

This week started with psudocode and flowcharts, also in this lecture, more complex python was introduced with for and while loop examples being brought in which I
found a lot harder to compute in my head than the previous session. In making my own flowchart, it was quite difficult to keep it tidy as I thought of more and more
stages to add as I went along, so trying to stay at an appropriate level of abstraction is the main challenge. Psudocode made a lot of sense to me, since it only
requires you to follow your own convention consistantly I found it fairly easy to represent the given task in psudocode form. This may be different if I'm faced with
representing a larger task as psudocode, but if I decide on my own conventions now, it will be easier down the line to stick to them.

In the studio/workshop, the main focus was on agile game development. I am somewhat familiar with agile development from my web dev job and I was able to understand
how to use trello since it was similar to jira which I have used before. The challenges in this session were coming up with user stories, and breaking down the
tasks that needed to be done into small enough segments so that they could be worked on my different people and be brought together afterwards.

The tinkering workshop introduced a practical on pyCharm which I have really enjoyed messing around with for several hours creating some kind of drawing game/tool
and picking up relevant pyGame coding which I can apply to characters and objects in future game projects on the software.

WEEK 4 (Logic gates, memory and image manipulation)

Logic gates and memory to the extent that we looked at them was fairly simple so no issues there.

The biggest challenge came from when I started on the task for the contracts. The main difficulty of this has been trying to think of ways to implement what I want
without a lot of knowledge about the capabilities of pygame, meaning that a method I had in mind may not be practical. The solution to this will really come from
just more practice of the code and getting to know what it can do and come up with practical solutions to the functionality I want to achieve.
